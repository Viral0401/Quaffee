ambience- sitting is not too pleasant. seems like the hotel reception staff is sitting with you. they should change arrangements. Other outside guests coming for rooms/hotel inquiry are also next to you.

The staff is very good, service is prompt and cheerful and they explain things to you if you're unsure. If you're lucky, you'll meet Sabina and it's impossible not to smile back at her, with her infectious energy.
