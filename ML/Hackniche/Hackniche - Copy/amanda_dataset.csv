Nitiksha Manihar,the coffee was just pathetic it was more of a shake,DINING,4.1,6 days ago
Avina Taneja,"The place when we visited was a lovely calm vibe and pleasant until last year. But I think the owners have left it to people who can‚Äôt handle ‚Äòbusy time‚Äô and are cold in their manner without really saying a word.
So if you are looking to have a pleasant experience on a Sunday morning, you could seek it elsewhere. The ladies here who serve are really ‚Äòcelebrity stricken‚Äô and very impolite.",DINING,3,5 months ago

Moumita D,"Every time I visit Ananda Cafe, I come away charmed !!! I enjoy the food recommendations, the presentation, the super warm and friendly staff and the gorgeous ambience!! This time it was the awesome fresh sugarcane juice with a tinge of ginger and lemon , which was an absolute delight!ü§©üëåNot to mention the avocado burrata open toastie which never fails to impress! Their breads are so so good! The coffee is always perfect (mocha with extra espresso shot for the perfect zing!). As are the Apple crumble and the delicious almond croissant for the ones with sweet cravings! The boutique at the cafe always has colourful , vibrant new items on display and I end up buying lovely gifts for...read more",DINING,2,8 months ago
Kareena G,"Good, quiet place. Healthy food options.
Walking right off the beach, just spotted this cafe on the way to the main road and decided to give it a go. Gave subtle quiet vibes.

The Chandra bowl was intriguing given the hot summers, was cooling as expected. Quantity was good too",DINING,4.1,9 months ago
Rupali Shah,"A quaint quiet cafe in the bylane next to old Centaur. The ambience was very calming esp. outside seating, but I guess not so cool during summer. Indoor seating is verrrry limited.
Limited menu, a tad overpriced and slow service. Had heard a lot about this cafe, but all of us felt slightly disappointed and we moved on to Bayleaf Cafe just ahead.",DINING,4,10 months ago

Bhashkar,"What a beautiful cafe, right next to Juhu Beach. I stopped at Ananda Cafe for a quick bite and coffee but ended up spending more than 2 hrs. While ordering the coffee I noticed that they have a small collection of spiritual and meta physics books for sale and I bought two. The next two hours were blissful, coffee and book makes the best pair. It‚Äôs not a typical cafe, it has a sense of calmness and you can feel the positive vibration something that I am not able to describe in words. Menu is different, from nachos to typical cafe food, and I could feel that food was made with love. The biggest surprise was a meditation room which I didn‚Äôt use but I saw a pamphlet for meditation classes...read more",DINING,3,"Feb 22, 2023"
Makhija,Good ambience. However - food menu is limited for a cafe. Customer service is average even when the restaurant is not busy. Food is sub par. Would not recommend or go back.,DINING,5,"Feb 14, 2023"

From spiritual books to Guardian Angels and Chakra Bracelets to the healthiest sourced organic and fulfilling food, Ananda CafeÃÅ is truly a unique visit. The decor is super pretty and the ambience is spiritual, lively and peaceful. Just people truly enjoying their gastronomical experience mindfully! ‚ú®

Akshay Goenka,"This place has recently opened up in the old lane connecting Juhu beach, next to tulip star hotel.

Fun fact -There used to be Bombay shirt company here for many many years.

The place is all about the VIBE althought the location & the food are awesome too.

It is a nice to place to sit & talk with minimal disturbance.

The place attracts a premium price which keeps the crowd premium, however i feel once the word of mouth spreads, it would be difficult to find a seat here.

We tried the below:-
1- Cafe Americano - Dark Roast - We like it strong & it was fantastic
2- Gyan Ice Tea - Lavender - This is a diff flavour & well blended - Recommended
3- Veggie Cream Cheese Bagel - Amazing !!!...read more",DINING,5,"May 29, 2022"

S Sinha,An excellent place for a fresh healthy lunch of Smoothie bowls and vegetable sourdough sandwiches followed by some delicious deserts. Everything was made of fresh ingredients & with a lot of care. Superb coffee too. We were warmly welcomed and made to feel at home. A nice place to chill out with friends over lunch or coffee/tea.,DINING,5,"Apr 20, 2022"
Arundhati Agarwala,The first time I went to ananda cafe the food was very good but quality of the food has drastically changed. The paneer wrap isn‚Äôt the same the nachos recipe has changed. They lack consistency. Was very disappointed. I wouldn‚Äôt recommend going there.,DINING,4.1,"Apr 12, 2022"
Hitesh Bhartia,"Fun relaxed place, reminds you of Pune cafe culture, takes you away from Mumbai busy life. Try the juices, coffee and desserts.",DINING,3,"Apr 11, 2022"
Priyanka Bhartia,"A tiny little gem in the bylines of juhu - so quaint, so calming and one feels one has arrived to a home of people who welco e you with utmost warmth! While I don't eat desserts, this one was outrageously fab - the chocolate tart, cookies were worth fighter for with my children! Even the spicy little roll, enchilada and paneer roll was awesome. The smoothie was a little liquid but that is probably because they went off sugar to customise it for us. Lovely concept and lovely go to place for my coffee",DINING,1,"Apr 11, 2022"
