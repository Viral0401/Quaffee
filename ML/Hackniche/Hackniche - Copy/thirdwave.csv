Shilpa,"been here on a saturday evening as other cafe had waiting. We highly repent visiting here.
Ordered 2 cuppacino and it was just warm and not at all hot

ordered a veg filled croissant and was totally ok.

my friend ordered a shredded chicken wrap and there was barely any chicken but loads of sauces filled in.

my another friend ordered mushroom on toast and that was the biggest let down as it was stale and he is now visiting doctors for sonography.

we ordered crisps platter and it turned out to be sauces on chips.

Parth,"Consider this a happy experience, and not just a review. I have been to this location, and many other locations before. But never have I been so satisfied with such a short visit. It would only be fair to give credit where due, and hence hope to have the love shared.

It started off as a prank from my friends, to make me the absolute worst combination of a drink that could ever be made. Naushad happily complied to the prank and customised a drink for me :p But, alas, it was a tasty one! He also asked for a genuine feedback! Pranks over, and the flavoured cold brew in the heat hit all the right notes :)

Of course, the Vietnamese style drinks, and Orange Zest mochas, and the mushroom...read more",DINING,4.1,8 months ago

It is nice quiet location inside the campus just opposite to Prithvi theatre, only issue is parking üÖøÔ∏è which you have to figure out if you self drive.

The decor is quite modern and artistic, with a youthful vibe. They have an interesting wall art with a coffee map route of the world with 3D metallic fish, water waves and cloth textures for the countries and coffee routes (pics attached). And terrazzo stones, french window seating with marble too, and beautiful Spanish tiles on the floor. The outside section has terrazzo tables.

We were full post dinner hence ordered...read more",DINING,5,8 months ago

We ordered some vietnamese shake which was amazing a hazelnut frappe and a sandwich I loved everything I had.
The best part was when I was waiting to use the restroom one of the staff gave me a card to write a message for my Father I was touched by thier gesture.
